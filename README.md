# Javascript Quiz

The quiz part works.

The high score function is completely broken.

At some point the text input for the player's initials stopped functioning, and the .value could no longer be accessed, which killed everything after it.

The high score function had other problems, but it did sort of work at some point and when that button stopped working, that was the end of that.
